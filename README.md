A data repo for the Pan-Africanism Data Project, which documents attendeeds of key events and gatherings of the Pan-Africanist movement from 1900-1959. The Pan-Africanism Data Project is directed by [Roopika Risam](http://roopikarisam.com) and the initial data sets were developed by Risam and Salem State students Jennifer Mahoney and Hibba Nassereddine. 

To create the data sets, Risam, Mahoney, and Nassereddine undertook archival and secondary source research to identify pan-Africanist events and to locate names of attendees. Sources are documented in the Pan-Africanism Data Project [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2368123/the_pan-africanism_data_project/library).

The data sets provided here are intended for re-use and modification under the repo's licensing terms. In addition, we have more extensive notes on our data sets that, for many of the events, indicate what percentage of attendees we have identified. We are happy to share this information, and we welcome pull requests with additional attendees, provided that a primary or secondary source citation is available to document attendance.
